as the the default login page is auth folder so we will create a page Admin_Auth.blade.php

and we will copy all the assets and other requirment even dashboard design to public folder and link its css and js to this Admin_Auth.blade.php then we will extend
its login dashboard and other register page  Better to copy all the css and js from dashboard index page  

 <link href="{{asset('assets/css/app.min.css')}}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" id="app-style" />
